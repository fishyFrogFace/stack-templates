# stack-templates
Some stack templates for personal use (my name is in the templates, so change this if you want to use them, unless you want me to have the copyright to your work :p)

## Installation
You need [Stack](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) to use these templates

## Usage
Navigate to the folder the cloned project is in and then run:
```
stack new <project-name> <template-name>
```
```
cd <project-name>
```
```
stack build
```
```
stack exec <project-name>-exe <path/to/file.txt>
```
